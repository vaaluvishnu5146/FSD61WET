**Git**:

Git is a version control system (VCS) that allows you to track changes in your files over time.
It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created Linux. 
Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every developer working on a project 
has a complete copy of the project's history on their local machine. 
This enables collaboration without a centralized server.
